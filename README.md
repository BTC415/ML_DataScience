# ML-and-DataScience-preparation

This repository has the goal to create a learning and preparation roadMap for Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists.

## Project Structure

The repository is splittend into two macrofolders: [Machine Learning](Machine%20Learning/README.md) and [Data Science](Data_Science/README.md).
Each section will have its own README file, containing a list of topic sorted from beginner to senior levels, with related e-learning resources or articles associated. 
Also in the README.md file, you will be able to find a ```Suggested Books``` section, containing a list of books useful for theory preparation, practice or interview preparation.
